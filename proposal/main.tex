\title{Do Leaders Export Pollution While Importing Wealth?}

\maketitle

Standard political economy literature \parencite[e.g.,][]{HodlerRaschky2014} has robustly established that leaders direct economic resources to their birth regions, a phenomenon visible via satellite nightlights. However, this narrative overlooks the environmental cost of such development. Our project proposes a novel dimension: \textbf{``Green Favoritism.''}

We hypothesize that sophisticated autocrats practice a ``Not In My Backyard'' (NIMBY) strategy: directing high-value, low-pollution sectors (tech, services) to their birth regions while relegating dirty heavy industry to peripheral or rival regions. We will test if leader birthplaces exhibit a ``decoupling'' effect: rising wealth (nightlights) without a corresponding spike in industrial pollution ($NO_2$). A finding that leader birthplaces have a significantly lower ``pollution elasticity of growth'' would provide the first empirical evidence of inequality in the quality of development, not just the quantity.

\section*{Datasets \& Methodology}

To isolate the causal impact of political power on environmental quality, we will employ a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework with high-dimensional fixed effects. This design compares the trajectory of a leader's birth district against all other districts within the same country, before and after their ascension to power.
